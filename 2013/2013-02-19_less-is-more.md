# 2013-02-19 LESS is more

tags: LESS, Visual Studio

If you're a Visual Studio web developer and you haven't tried out the [Web Essentials extension](http://vswebessentials.com/) by [Mads Kristensen](https://madskristensen.net/), then GO NOW, GET IT!

And for those who do know about it, and you were using it for it's [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) support, then you may have noticed in the last update how it was removed :( The only alternative then would appear to have been [T4CSS](https://github.com/dotless/dotless/blob/master/t4less/T4CssWeb/Css/T4CSS.tt).

But the same day I updated and saw the lack of LESS support, was the same day that I realised it's now baked into Visual Studio in the most recent [ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 Update](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/announcing-release-of-asp-net-and-web-tools-2012-2-update).

It supports adding LESS files from the New Item dialog, and upon build will generate the CSS and minified CSS for it too. Which is obviously [the reason it was removed from Web Essentials](https://twitter.com/mkristensen/status/303645364664287233)
