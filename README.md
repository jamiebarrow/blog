# jamiebarrow - blog

Welcome to my blog.

In the past I had used [blogspot](https://jamiebarrow.blogspot.com/) for my blog, and even tried to host it on [jamiebarrow.dev](https://jamiebarrow.dev) with [Gatsby](./2020/2020-02-04_gatsbyjs-blog.md).

As part of that process, I moved my content into Markdown files, which is even simple to view in a simple Git repo using tools like Visual Studio code,
or if hosted on Github using their built in previews of Markdown files.

I might start generating the actual site from this again someday, but for now its easiest to just create content here.

Perhaps then I'll post more often in any case :)
