# 2018-06-28 Useful links for migrating AngularJS to Angular

tags: angular, cheatsheet, webpack

So I jotted down a whole lot of links for when I was learning webpack, and thought maybe someday I'd write a blog post, but that I probably wouldn't really. That day may come, but that day is not now :P Posting this in case others may want to browse through the links that I found useful when trying to convert an application in AngularJS 1.x with Gulp, using ngupgrade with Angular5 and webpack, onto just one build with the Angular CLI.
