# 2020-02-04 GatsbyJS

tags: blog, gatsbyjs, graphql, static site generator, SSG

It has been quite a while since my last blog post. I have decided to try and
move to a new blogging platform that will make it easier for me to type out
my posts more easily.

When looking around, I decided to try also use it to learn a new technology, and
since I still have not yet looked fully at ReactJS yet, I decided to make it a
point to learn it at the same time.

Two options that seemed quite popular in this regard are
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Both seemed quite similar, are quite well documented, and both support static
site generation. I preferred the way Gatsby handles things, especially its use
of GraphQL to resolve data/files - e.g. you can write your blog posts using
[Markdown](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/) quite easily,
or let it be processed by a [plugin to embed a Tweet](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/@weknow/gatsby-remark-twitter/) just by recognizing a Twitter
link in the Markdown... pretty awesome.

I hope that this will not only improve my learning about ReactJS and GraphQL
but that it will also mean some more knowledge sharing and blogging for me in
future :)
