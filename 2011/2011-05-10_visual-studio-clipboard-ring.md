# 2011-05-10 Visual Studio Clipboard Ring

tags: C#, Microsoft, programming, tips, Visual Studio

Today I found out about the Visual Studio Clipboard Ring, which keeps the last 15 entries that you have entered into the clipboard using copy and cut (<kbd>CTRL+C</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL+V</kbd>, <kbd>SHIFT+DEL</kbd>), and lets you paste into the Visual Studio Editor an item from that list.

You just press <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+V</kbd> when pasting, and each successive press will cycle through the entries. Very useful if you kept something on the clipboard, but then pressed <kbd>SHIFT+DEL</kbd> to delete a line, forgetting about what you wanted to paste! Which I tend to do a lot!
